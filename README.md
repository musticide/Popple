Bubble Shooter (C++ / raylib / Android)

A lightweight, high-performance bubble shooter game written in C++ using raylib, built and deployed for Android via Android Studio, without relying on any third-party libraries beyond raylib itself.

This project is focused on engine-level understanding, performance-oriented design, clean architecture, exploring rendering and graphics techniques.

🎮 Game Overview

- Tap bubbles before they reach the center
- Missing or letting bubbles escape counts as a failure
- Game ends after a fixed number of escaped bubbles
- Designed as a casual, endless arcade experience (for now)

**Primary goals:**
- Maintain high performance on low-end Android devices
- Explore rendering and graphics techniques to build a unique look
- Build a sellable, extensible foundation in C++

**Technical Goals**

- Learn and apply engine-style architecture in C++
- Avoid hidden abstractions introduced by large engines
- Understand rendering, input, timing, and resource management deeply
- Target Android performance constraints explicitly

**🛠 Technology Stack**
Language	- C++
Graphics / Input	- raylib
Platform	Android
Build System	Android NDK (via Android Studio)
